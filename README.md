## Getting Started

This project was created by running Create React App on Node v15.5.0.

# Instructions

We have a small front-end coding test for you. You have 3 hours to complete this test. When completed, push a final commit to the repository with only the message "finished" to let us know that you're done.

Fidelity and attention to detail are important aspects of this position (e.g. spacing, fonts, animation timing, etc). In that regard, please implement the design shown in the following links as faithfully as possible. Feel free to add any files or make any changes to the existing repo that you feel are necesary.

1. Please implement this visual design:
