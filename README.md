## Getting Started

This project was created by running Create React App on Node v15.5.0.

# Instructions

We have a small front-end coding test for you. You have 3 hours to complete this test. When completed, push a final commit to the repository with only the message "finished" to let us know that you're done.

Fidelity and attention to detail are important aspects of this position (e.g. spacing, fonts, animation timing, etc). In that regard, please implement the design shown in the following links as faithfully as possible. You will need to use the attached image asset ('arrow.svg').

1. Please implement this visual design:

2. In the same design, please implement the hover and click states for the button as prototyped here:

3. In the same design, please dynamically retrieve the length of the array at the following endpoint and programmatically append that number to the end of the headline in the protoype:
