# Instructions

Hello,

We have a small front-end coding test for you. You have 3 hours to complete the test. You should have been given access to a private GitHub repo to start. When completed, push a final commit to the repository with only the message "finished" to let us know that you're done. 

Fidelity and attention to detail are important aspects of this position (e.g. spacing, fonts, animation timing, etc). In that regard, please implement the design shown in the following links as faithfully as possible. You will need to use the image asset included in the repo ('arrow.svg').

1. Please implement this visual design:

2. In the same design, please implement the hover and click states for the button as prototyped here:

3. In the same design, please dynamically replace the Lorem Ipsum text with the names of 10 Star Wars characters from this endpoint:
